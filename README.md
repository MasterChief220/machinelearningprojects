## In Progress 
Doing projects from the book Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow

## Project 1:
To create a Linear Regression Model, we will be using the [California Housing Prices](https://github.com/ageron/data/raw/main/housing.tgz) dataset. The goal is for the model to learn from this dataset and make predictions on housing prices.
